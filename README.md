This reponsitory is the companion to my Tech Talk at the [Cisco DevNet Create 2019](https://developer.cisco.com/devnetcreate/2019), titled "Network Data Analysis with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana". Since I seems to always forget important details and find missing pieces **after** talks, I hope to at least make up for some of them with this repository.

### Short Talk Pitch

Many, if not most, business problems can be solved with answering a question search. But few people do, the problem is usually with the search speed and accuracy. In this talk, we will use Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, also known as the "ELK Stack" to accurately retrieve and analyze network data to derive business conclusion in a timely manner.
